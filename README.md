# 🎯 Frontend Learning Exercise

Welcome to the **Frontend Learning Exercise**! This repository contains a comprehensive learning project to help you master **Next.js**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS** by building a practical todo application.

## 📋 What You'll Build

A **Todo List Application** with a **Counter** component, featuring:

- ✅ **Counter Component** with Redux state management
- ✅ **Todo List** with full CRUD operations
- ✅ **Dark Mode** toggle with CSS custom properties
- ✅ **Notification System** with context API
- ✅ **Modal System** for confirmations
- ✅ **Responsive Design** with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Redux Persistence** with localStorage
- ✅ **Animations** with Framer Motion
- ✅ **TypeScript** throughout the application

## 🚀 How to Start the Exercise

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd counter-todolist-exercice-nextjs
```

### Step 2: Switch to the Exercise Branch
```bash
git checkout exercise
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Follow the Exercise Guide
Open `EXERCISE_GUIDE.md` and follow the step-by-step instructions to build the application from scratch.

## 📚 Learning Path

The exercise is structured in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Project Setup & Basic Structure
2. **Phase 2**: Counter Component with Redux
3. **Phase 3**: Todo List with CRUD Operations
4. **Phase 4**: Common Components (Button, Input, Modal)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (Persistence, Search, Filtering)
6. **Phase 6**: Layout & Styling (Dark Mode, Responsive Design)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ **Next.js**: Project setup, routing, and development workflow
- ✅ **Redux Toolkit**: State management, actions, reducers, and selectors
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling and responsive design
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Type safety and interfaces
- ✅ **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic patterns
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Best practices and patterns

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
